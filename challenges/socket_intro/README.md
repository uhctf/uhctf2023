## Description
Some computer programs must be available over a network. The address where we can find the program consists of 2 parts:
- an IP address: the address of the computer
- a port number: the address of the application

To send raw data to a program over a network, connect to it as follows: `nc <ip> <port>` (read `nc` as `netcat`).

Tell the program on `<TODO_IP>:<TODO_PORT>` to "open sesame".
