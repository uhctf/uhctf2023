## Description
<!-- HTML can be used here if needed -->
I use a little script to play my favorite word guessing game: Wordle.
While playing one night, I was reminded that I was supposed to generate flags for the CTF... so I just rewrote the script to generate a flag!
Anyway, I got a pretty awful result that day using my script ğŸ˜Ÿ
```
Wordle 496 9/6
