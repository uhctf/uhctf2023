    <summary><strong>5%</strong>: Help using gdb.</summary>
    gdb is a powerful tool to see what a program is doing at runtime. However, it's a cli tool that doesn't show much information, causing newcomers to easily get lost. Try installing <a src="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a>.

    <summary><strong>15%</strong>: Where is the vulnerability?</summary>
    Open the binary in Ghidra. Look for places where you can interact with the program.

    Don't be afraid to read documentation on C standard library functions! <i>man [function_name]</i> or simply Google will help you out!
