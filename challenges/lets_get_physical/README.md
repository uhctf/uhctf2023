## Description

All night, I'll hide onto you. I know you got my badge and I know I got you, so common. C'mon. Comooooon. Let's get Physical!

Some UHCTF crew members have a bright **yellow** card (NFC badge), standing in for a meaningful document (like an access badge to a datacenter). Your goal is to skim it using your smartphone.

We have some **pink** dummy cards, so you can test whether your smartphone can scan the codes. These work on the same principle as the other ones, but don't have the correct flag. Let us know if no one in your team can scan a badge. We have a spare phone.

## Setup

Have a few NFC badges, write the flag to them and write-protect them. Wear during CTF.
