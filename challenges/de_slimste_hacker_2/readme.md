## Description
<!-- HTML can be used here if needed -->
Wait, what? Another round?! Wow, that's so not cool. I would've imagined that the final round would be the final round. But, as I said before: your opponent has taken this personal. Some say that he’s a CTR experiment that went wrong, and that he only speaks exclusive, or plain-text. And that he likes to be answered in the same language. And that he uses 16 bytes to shift. All we know is he’s not the Stig, but he is the Stig’s Cryptographic Cousin.
