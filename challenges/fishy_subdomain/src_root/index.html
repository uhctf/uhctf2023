    <p>A letter from the challenge creator:</p>
    <p id="letter">"In order to find the subdomain, you must use OSINT data. Unfortunately for you, I've created this website as secure as can be, even though I've used shared hosting. I use it as I'm a cheapskate. I WOULD NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING IF THERE'S A FREE VERSION AVAILABLE SINCE 2014! Anyway, there's no point in attacking the hosting, nameservers, mailservers etc. Only looking at the data presented to you. While the answer is not streamed to your browser when visiting this page, it is accompanied with something far more valuable (and priceless, i.e. free)."</p>
