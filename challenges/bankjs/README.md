# Description

Someone attempted to write a bank application in everyone's favorite programming language. And of course, it uses its own cryptocurrency, bankjs dollars (BJ$). They gave me a live version, a demo account on there and a copy of the source code. Can you show them how the app is flawed?

# Attachments

- A copy of this source code (everything in the src and static folder)
- Link to a running version of the docker container
