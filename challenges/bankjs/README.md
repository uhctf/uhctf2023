# Description

Someone attempted to write a bank application in everyone's favorite programming language. They gave me a live version, a demo account on there and a copy of the source code. Can you show them how the app is flawed?

# Attachments

- A copy of this source code (except for the README and git history off course)
- Link to a running version of the docker container

# Deployment

To deploy the challenge, build and run the docker, with your flag of choice as a environment variable:

```bash
docker build -t bankjs .
docker run -p 80:80 -e FLAG="uhctf{js_more_like_jf*ck_abcdef}" bankjs
```

# Writeup

By browsing through the source, you can see that you can get the flag from sending a tip to the admin.

The catch is that parseInt takes a string as input, but we gave it a number, which will trigger automatic type conversion.
Now, if you try 0.00000005, you'll see that the string conversion for that yields "5e-8". Now, that same string is fed as input to parseInt, which will take the first integer part, being 5.
