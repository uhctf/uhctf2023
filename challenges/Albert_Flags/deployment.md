To test this challenge:
run the ss.py script from a terminal window with some uhctf{...} string as parameter.

This should pop up a POS terminal.
During the CTF a computer with only a barcode scanner will be available. And actual items will be available for scanning.
To test part 1: you can simply enter the following "bar codes" (as found in products.txt)
1 -> bier
2 -> cola
3 -> snoep
"End" -> to end the sale and go to checkout
"New" -> to start a new sale after checkout

For part 1 it is not neccesary to use the manual to reconfigure the handheld scanner. 

Part 2 will require reading the manual and reconfiguring the barcode scanner. Then by combining the steps from part 1, it is possible to get further into the computer.
