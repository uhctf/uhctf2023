Good evening. My name is Angelo Quadrallupo and I am here to defend my client Giuseppe Calzanoni at all cost.
He has contacted me to proof his innocent in this murder case. 
The police suspects my client that he killed the maffia boss of Sicily, Vincenzo Roccar√† Squarcialupi Brancaleone.

They suspect this because of this photo that someone took, saying that this person was sitting next right to the killer.
But I am absolutely sure that my client, Giuseppe, did not commit the murder. In order to proof that, we have to first find the date on which this picture was taken.
Can you please help my client to proof his innoncence ?

Note: you only have one chance of providing the right date when this picture was taken. This should be in the format of YYMMDD. 
After a fail attempt, the challenge will be closed for your team.
