    <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef">CyberChef</a> is an excellent tool for converting between many different types of data. CyberChef can often guess which conversions would make the most sense; simply paste your data in the input field, and click the magic wand above the output field if it appears. If not, you can easily play with the different conversion options yourself.

## Description
<!-- HTML can be used here if needed -->
