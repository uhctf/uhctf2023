## Description
<!-- HTML can be used here if needed -->
Dear Diary,

Today I stumbled upon something interesting - a hacker's diary! I managed to gain access to their computer and found a document labeled "Diary". I couldn't resist the urge to take a peek inside.

As I opened the diary, I found that the hacker had been documenting their cyber attacks. They had recorded information about their targets, methods, and tools used for each attack. It was like reading a thrilling detective novel, but with a dark twist.

I decided to turn this discovery into a challenge for my fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts. I created a Forensic CTF challenge where participants will have access to the hacker's diary and will need to use their skills in digital forensics and cryptography to uncover the hacker's secrets.

I can't wait to see how my fellow challengers will fare against this challenge. Will they be able to uncover the secrets of the hacker's diary? Only time will tell.

Yours truly,
Hackerman
